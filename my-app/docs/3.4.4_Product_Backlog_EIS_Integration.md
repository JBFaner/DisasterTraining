## INT-1: Certification Tracking System Integration

### Description
Implement a comprehensive certification tracking system that integrates with the existing evaluation and attendance system to automatically track, issue, and manage participant certifications.

### User Stories

**As a System Administrator,**
- I want to view all issued certifications in a centralized dashboard
- I want to track certification expiration dates
- I want to generate certification reports
- I want to revoke or invalidate certifications when needed

**As an LGU Admin,**
- I want to see which participants are eligible for certification
- I want to issue certificates to eligible participants
- I want to track certification status for my organization's participants
- I want to export certification data

**As a Participant,**
- I want to view my earned certifications
- I want to download my certificates
- I want to verify my certification status
- I want to see my certification history

### Features/Tasks

1. **Certification Database Schema**
   - Create `certifications` table
   - Link to `participant_evaluations` table
   - Track certification metadata (issue date, expiry date, certificate number)
   - Status: ✅ Completed (via `is_eligible_for_certification` field)

2. **Certification Eligibility Engine**
   - Automatically determine eligibility based on:
     - Evaluation score (pass threshold)
     - Attendance status (completed)
     - Event completion
   - Status: ✅ Completed

3. **Certificate Generation**
   - PDF certificate template
   - Dynamic content (name, date, event, score)
   - Digital signature support
   - Status: 🚧 In Progress

4. **Certification Dashboard**
   - View all certifications
   - Filter by participant, event, date range
   - Search functionality
   - Status: 📋 Planned

5. **Certification API Endpoints**
   - GET `/api/certifications` - List certifications
   - GET `/api/certifications/{id}` - Get specific certification
   - POST `/api/certifications/verify` - Verify certificate
   - Status: 📋 Planned

6. **Certificate Verification System**
   - Public verification page
   - Certificate number lookup
   - QR code generation for certificates
   - Status: 📋 Planned

7. **Certification Export**
   - CSV export
   - PDF report generation

   - Status: 📋 Planned

### Technical Requirements

- **Database**: Extend `participant_evaluations` table or create new `certifications` table
- **Storage**: Store certificate PDFs in `storage/app/certificates/`
- **API**: RESTful API for certification management
- **Security**: Role-based access control for certification operations

### Integration Points

1. **Evaluation System**
   - Read evaluation results
   - Check pass/fail status
   - Verify attendance completion

2. **User Management**
   - Link certifications to users
   - Track user certification history
