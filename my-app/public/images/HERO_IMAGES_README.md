# Hero Images Setup

## Required Images

Place your hero images in the `public/images/` directory:

### Main Hero Image
- **Filename**: `hero-training.jpg`
- **Recommended**: Use the disaster preparedness training room image (first attachment)
- **Dimensions**: 1920x1080px or larger
- **Description**: Shows the command center/training setup with monitors and tactical plans

### Alternative Images
You can use any of these themes:
1. **Training Room** - Command center with monitors and equipment
2. **Field Equipment** - Safety gear, helmets, ropes, and tools
3. **Tactical Planning** - Radios, maps, and emergency supplies

## How to Add Images

1. Save your chosen image from the attachments
2. Rename it to `hero-training.jpg`
3. Place it in: `public/images/hero-training.jpg`
4. The hero section will automatically use it with the gradient overlay

## Current Design Features

✅ Large hero image background
✅ Dark gradient overlay (Blue to Teal)
✅ Text with drop shadows for readability
✅ Cinematic fixed background effect
✅ Professional branding

## Gradient Overlay

The gradient applied is:
- Dark blue-gray at top (rgba(20, 30, 48, 0.9))
- Mid-tone blue at center (rgba(36, 59, 85, 0.85))
- Teal at bottom (rgba(58, 118, 117, 0.8))

This creates depth and ensures text remains readable over any image.
